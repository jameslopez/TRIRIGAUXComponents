<!--
A component that retrieves the current weather information for a given location from The Weather Channel (TWC) using the TWC API.
Weather observations are generated on demand from The Weather Channel Currents On Demand system.
The return observation object contains weather data such as temperatures, winds, and pressure.

<div style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
    <div style="padding:20px;">
  <b>Note:</b> The Weather Channel API requires a license and is constrained by the API Key entitlements. To use this component, update the TRIRIGAWEB.properties file and set The Weather Channel API license key in the WEATHER_API_KEY property.
	</div>
</div>

Example of requesting the current weather conditions for postal code 30075 in the United States. 

    <triplat-weather-current
		 	auto
		 	postal-and-country-code="30075:US"
		 	observation="{{observationCurrent}}"></triplat-weather-current>

Example of requesting the current weather conditions for a location specified by latitude and longitude. 

    <triplat-weather-current
		 	auto
		 	lat-and-long="34.021944:-84.359167"
		 	observation="{{observationCurrent}}"></triplat-weather-current>

Example of displaying the current temperature and a phrase that describes the weather conditions.

    <div class="temps">{{observationCurrent.imperial.temp}} Fahrenheit</div>
    <div class="blurb">{{observationCurrent.phrase_32char}}</div>

		 	
### Units of measurement

The Weather Channel API supports the following units of measurement: e = English units, m = Metric units, and h = Hybrid units (UK).
Example of requesting the current weather conditions with Metric units. The return observation includes temperatures in Celsius.  

    <triplat-weather-current
		 	auto
		 	postal-and-country-code="30075:US"
		 	units="m"
		 	observation="{{observationCurrent}}"></triplat-weather-current>

### Translation

The Weather Channel API handles the translation of phrases. A valid language must be passed along the request.
Example of requesting the current weather conditions with the Spanish language. The return observation has phrases in Spanish.  

    <triplat-weather-current
		 	auto
		 	postal-and-country-code="30075:US"
		 	language="es-ES"
		 	observation="{{observationCurrent}}"></triplat-weather-current>


As mentioned above, the return observation object includes many properties that describe the weather conditions. It also includes icon information such as icon codes and their associated weather phrases.  
  
See The Weather Channel API documentation for more details about the current weather information and usage.
