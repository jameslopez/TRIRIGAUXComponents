	/**
	 * Implement `triblock-app-layout-banner-routing-behavior` on your main view element that that contains `triblock-app-layout`. This helps with configuration concerning the mobile page label and back button based on `triplat-routing` behaviors. Additional configuration is as follows: 
	 *
     * First, listen for `triplat-route`'s `route-active` event.
     * ```html
	 *	<triplat-route id="newRoute" name="new" path="/new" on-route-active="_handleNewRouteActive"></triplat-route>
     * ```
	 * 
     * Then, set up the custom event needed for the `manageBannerOnRouteChange` function where "New" and `true` values are defined by you.
     * ```javascript
     *   _handleNewRouteActive: function (e) {
     *      var routedPageBannerDetails = { active: e.detail.active, pageLabel: "New", hasBackButton: true };
     *      this.manageBannerOnRouteChange(routedPageBannerDetails);
     *   }
     * ```
	 * @polymerBehavior
	 */
    TriBlockAppLayoutBannerRoutingBehaviorImpl = {
        /**
        * Sets `showMobileBackButton` and `mobilePageLabel` properties based on custom event
        * 
		* @param {object} routedPageBannerDetails must have `active`, `hasBackButton` and `pageLabel` properties (see above documentation for more details)
        */
        manageBannerOnRouteChange: function(routedPageBannerDetails) {
            if (routedPageBannerDetails.active) {
				this.set('showMobileBackButton', routedPageBannerDetails.hasBackButton);
				this.set('mobilePageLabel', routedPageBannerDetails.pageLabel);
            }
        },
